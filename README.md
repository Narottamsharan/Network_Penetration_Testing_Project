# Network_Penetration_Testing_Project
Project Title:
Network Penetration Testing with Real-World Exploits and Security Remediation

Project Description:
This project demonstrates real-world penetration testing techniques using Kali Linux as the attacking machine and Metasploitable 2 as the vulnerable target. It includes network scanning, enumeration, exploitation of known services, user privilege escalation, password cracking, and security remediation.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Kali Linux (Attacker OS)

Metasploitable 2 (Target OS)

Nmap – Network and port scanning

Metasploit Framework – Exploitation

John the Ripper – Password cracking

Linux Commands – User management and system enumeration

Tasks Covered:
Basic Network Scan

Port and Service Enumeration

Operating System Detection

Enumeration of Open and Hidden Services

Exploitation of Vulnerable Services (FTP, SSH, Java RMI)

Creating a Root User

Cracking Password Hashes

Remediation for Detected Vulnerabilities

Learning Outcomes:
Hands-on experience with ethical hacking tools.

Understanding how attackers scan, identify, and exploit system vulnerabilities.

Gained knowledge on security best practices and how to defend against common attacks.

Learned the importance of regular updates, service hardening, and strong password policies.

How to Use:
Open the Word document Network_Penetration_Testing_Project.docx.

Follow the tasks step by step in your own lab setup.

Replace IP addresses and usernames with your own values where applicable.
